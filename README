Amazing is the to-be backronymed version of A.W.E.S.O.M.E. (Dutch: A.W.E.S.O.M.E.: Wegstreep ExpertSysteem Om Makkelijk te Eten). It is a python&django web-based POS(Point of Sale)-system to replace the POS(...)-system that is currently in place. Also a testing and learning ground for my first endeavour into web-apps (so to start there will be a few tutorials and some rubbish code, bear with me ;-) ).
